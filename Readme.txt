Building the system:
===================
1- Setup the variable $PTH in makefile to the current path of the makefile.
2- Enter the following commands
   make clean
   make exp
3- Test the built code on simple random graphs
   make test                           

Using the System:
================
1- On random graphs  :: Look at the instructions in tests/IncDFS_Exp.cpp
2- On real graphs    :: Look at the instructions in tests/IncDFS_Real_Fast.cpp
3- The corresponding binary files are already built by 'make exp' command.
